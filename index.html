        Hi, I'm Sathvi and welcome to my website!
        I'm a '22 at Dartmouth College and I'm from Nashua, New Hampshire. At Dartmouth, I'm majoring in Computer Science, and I'd like to gain experience in software development. 
        Some things I enjoy are music, movies, running and just living life!

    <h3> More About Me </h3>
    <p>I first started learning Python and Java programming for fun through Codecademy the summer after 10th grade. I was curious to learn what this whole coding thing was,
      especially since some of my friends kept talking about it! Then, I took AP Computer Science A during senior year and this class helped build up my programming skills.
      At Dartmouth, I took CS 1 and CS 10 my freshman year, and they helped solidify my interest in computer science. Last term I took CS 50, and I'm currently taking CS 30. Though CS 30 is a whole
      new beast, I'm learning so much and really enjoying it! </p>
    <p>Over the past few years, I've picked up programming and development skills here and there. These are some programming languages and tools that I have experience with! </p>

    <h3> Why DALI </h3>
    <p>I would love the opportunity to work at DALI because I've realized that the aspect of software engineering that I love most is the endless opportunities it holds!
      The ability to make tools that benefit others and create solutions to problems by applying problem solving skills through coding is exciting!</p>
    <p>I also really want to learn more about software development and learn how to use more languages and tools. I've really enjoyed all that I've learned
      in CS classes here at Dartmouth, and I'm looking forward to learning more! I truly think that working in DALI's collaborative environment would enable me
      to learn more about programming and allow me to learn from my peers.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I'm really interested in the process that goes behind designing and programming applications. I'm looking forward to learn more about
      the planning and designing process behind creating a product with an end goal in mind.</p>

    <h3> What I Do </h3>
    <p> At Dartmouth, I'm a TA for CS 1, a member of Women in Computer Science, an interviewer for the Humans of Dartmouth Project, and an arts writer for The Dartmouth.
      I've also done research in the application of natural language processing on clinical data through the Women in Science Project (WISP).
    </p>
    <p> In my free time, I enjoy being outdoors. You can find me running, hiking, ice skating, "doing homework on the green", and napping on hammocks with friends. I
      also love trying new outdoorsy things, and I'm currently learning how to cross country ski (yup, even though I'm from New Hampshire, I don't know how to ski)! </p>

    <p> My favorite way to unwind after a long day is to watch an episode or two of a TV show! I'm currently watching Brooklyn 99.
      Hit me up with some TV show recommendations! </p>
    <p>I also listen to a copious amount of music!! My favorite artist at the moment is Maggie Rogers and my favorite genre of music is indie-pop/indie-rock.
      I'll listen to music from most other genres depending on my mood. I CANNOT stand heavy metal/screamo, but I tolerate country! </p>

    <h3>Fun Facts and Things I Love!</h3>
    <p>My favorite color is blue and I own 23 pieces of blue clothing. :) </p>
    <p> I was born in Massachusetts and moved to New Hampshire when I was 2, so I've lived in New England my whole life! </p>
    <p> As I previously mentioned, I love listening to music and I could not live without it. My love for music stems from my childhood,
      because I learned to play the piano starting when I was 7. In high school, I really wanted to learn how to play the guitar so I taught myself!
      I'm also a singer, as I grew up training in Indian classical music. Nowadays, I mostly sing in the shower and hum all the songs stuck in my head
      while walking around campus.</p>
    <p> I've recently become obsessed with TikTok and even though I can't really dance, I can't stop renegading...one of my goals is to become TikTok famous :P </p>
    <p>Another fun fact about me is that I love traveling! I enjoy exploring new places and learning more about their history. I would love
      to spend an entire year just traveling around the world! Some of the places I've been to recently are: </p>
